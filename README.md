Marks those annoying mobile-first designed news stories 

## Why does this exist?
Yle's (the Finnish broadcasting company) online news sometimes feature news stories which are presented like "stories" on social media platforms. These "articles" are heavily mobile centric and not desktop friendly. I got annoyed at clicking an article and being presented with that. So I decided to write a plugin which clearly marks the articles as such.

# Articles are marked as such:
